=head1 NAME

Path::ExpandTilde - Expand tilde (~) to homedir in file paths

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Path::ExpandTilde;
  my $homedir = expand_tilde('~');
  my $bashrc = expand_tilde('~/.bashrc');
  my $pg_home = expand_tilde('~postgres');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module uses C<bsd_glob> from L<File::Glob> to portably expand a leading
tilde (C<~>) in a file path into the current or specified user's home
directory. No other L<glob metacharacters|File::Glob/"META CHARACTERS"> are
expanded.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 expand_tilde

  my $new_path = expand_tilde($path);

Exported by default. If the path starts with C<~>, expands that to the current
user's home directory. If the path starts with C<< ~I<username> >>, expands
that to the specified user's home directory. If the user doesn't exist, no
expansion is done. The returned path is canonicalized as by
L<File::Spec/"canonpath"> either way.

=head1 NOTES

The algorithm should be portable to most operating systems supported by Perl,
though the home directory may not be found by C<bsd_glob> on some.
